Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js (v14 or higher)
    MongoDB (for local development)

Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-lobby-api.git
cd movie-lobby-api

2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

npm install

3. Set Up MongoDB

    Local MongoDB: If you donâ€™t have MongoDB installed, follow the installation guide on MongoDB's official website for your platform.
    Start MongoDB: If MongoDB is already installed, run the following command to start it locally:

mongod

The database will run on mongodb://localhost:27017/movielobby.
4. Configure the Application

    By default, the app will connect to a local MongoDB instance at mongodb://localhost:27017/movielobby. If you want to use a different database or a cloud database, update the MongoDB URI in the src/app.ts file.

5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and MongoDB is running, start the application with the following command:

npm start

The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.
